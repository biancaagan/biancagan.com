                <h3 class="page-text">
                        I wanted to do something with a physical output for this project, and I really
                        liked the video Yeseul showed us in class of the 
                        <a class="sub-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE7XhlgnaEQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                <h3 class="page-text">
                        So my original idea was to do a physical drum machine, using a similar drum
                        head from the video, maybe a cowbell, or a triangle. I played with the idea of
                        either doing a digital interface on P5 or a physical interface like buttons or a
                        Playstation controller.<br><br>
                        A basic sketch below is what I thought it could look like and an example of a
                        digital interface.

                        While I was looking at the materials I would need, I decided to do glasses of
                        water and spoons instead because it would be significantly cheaper. Plus, I
                        like the idea better of having six glasses all tuned to different notes with the
                        amount of water in them.<br><br>
                        While I was home over break, I bought a bunch of spoons from Ikea and had
                        my step dad help me drill holes into them so that I would be able to mount it
                        onto a servo motor.<br><br>
                        The sketch below is what I’d like the layout of the servos / spoons / glasses
                        to be in.

                <h3 class="page-text">
                        My thought is to have six glasses of different amounts of water tuned to C – D
                        – E – F – G – A. And what’s great is that if I want to change the tune I can
                        simply just change the amount of water. I will also have six buttons
                        correlating to each ‘note’ as well as a couple of preprogrammed buttons that
                        will play a tune.<br><br>
                        I think I will call this project SPOONS. Very creative, I know.<br><br>
                        Below is a bill of materials and rough production schedule.

                        I started by making sure that I’d be able to mount the spoons onto the servo
                        motors.<br><br>
                        When purchasing the servo motors, I had thought they’d be larger and closer
                        to the model we’ve been using in class. They’re pretty tiny, BUT luckily the
                        servo motors have so far managed to hold up and operate as I’d intended.

                        Next, I moved on to rigging up the three spoons to three glasses
                        of water and I also programmed one button to play a series of
                        notes. Nothing a little cardboard and gaff tape can’t handle.

                        So, I spent about half an hour one afternoon trying to ‘tune’ the
                        glasses to a C, D, E, F, G, and A… only to discover that the glasses
                        I have purchased will tune to a highest note of G flat at best.
                        Which eliminates my ability to have an A. The highest note it
                        tunes to is a kind of sharp G flat, so I’m going to use it to pass as
                        my G note.<br><br>
                        Next, I’m planning out the layout of all the glasses and motors/spoons.

                        I then moved on to programming a few buttons to play an entire
                        melody. It’s been a bit tricky finding sheet music that only uses C, D, E, F, G.<br><br>
                        When coding this, I also wanted a better / cleaner way of writing the
                        songs. So what I did was made functions for each of the notes, called
                        them individually for their individual buttons, and that way it made it
                        much easier to code the tunes, instead of copying and pasting several
                        lines of code for each note, I simply just had to call the function and
                        space the notes with a delay.

                        The third servo as you can see in the video spazzes a little, I
                        need to try and fix that. I’ve since replaced the motor, but it
                        seems to still do that more than the others, I’ll look into it.<br><br>
                        Also, on my quest to find songs that only use the five notes I
                        have, I figured I should just add a B below the C and bring my
                        number of notes/motors back to my original intended six.<br><br>
                        Next, I’m going to fabricate the center mount for the motors,
                        solder everything onto a PCB, figure out the wiring, and also the
                        interface. I still haven’t decided if I wanted to just use buttons or
                        make some other type of user interface.<br><br>
                        So originally I wanted everything to be in a circle, but I figured
                        creating the center mount would be easier if it were just straight
                        rows. I also like the idea better of being able to see directly into
                        the middle of everything.

                        under the platform where the servos are on, and from the
                        protoboard it needs to connect to the Arduino, and I need a
                        second protoboard in the user interface enclosure for the
                        buttons which will also connect to the Arduino.<br><br>
                        At the start I was mounting everything onto one protoboard, and
                        soon realized I needed the two separate ones. On the PCB for
                        the servos, I solder on dip sockets so that in case a servo
                        needed to be replaced, it would be easier to swap them out.<br><br>
                        I purchased screw terminals for the Arduino Uno, because it felt
                        more sturdy and reliable than just popping the wires into the dip
                        sockets on the Uno.

                        After finishing the servo proto-board, I tested it with my
                        breadboard that still had the buttons from before.<br><br>
                        I ran into an issue where two of the servos wouldn’t work. At first
                        it was the second and third, then it changed. I tried reseating the
                        header pins and making sure the connections were secure.
                        Eventually it started working, I’m not exactly sure what the issue
                        is, but I’m pretty sure it was how the servos were seated in the
                        dip sockets.

                        I then worked on building the enclosure for the buttons and
                        mounting everything, and hot gluing all of the panels together.<br><br>
                        I then tested the buttons with the servos after everything was
                        transferred onto proto-boards. And lo and behold — ISSUES!!!<br><br>
                        The four buttons programmed to play songs weren’t working. So
                        I looked all over the board seeing if anything was disconnected,
                        or shorting, only to finally discover that I forgot to connect the
                        power lines to the power bus from the Arduino that everything
                        else is on.

                        Once I soldered those connections, I tested it again and all 10
                        buttons worked, thank god! The last thing to do was to finish
                        assembling the enclosures. As a precaution, because I had a
                        weird issue with a couple of the servo connections, I taped them
                        securely to the header pins on the proto-board with some
                        electrical tape.<br><br>
                        The last step was to safely walk it to the floor and play-testing in
                        class!
